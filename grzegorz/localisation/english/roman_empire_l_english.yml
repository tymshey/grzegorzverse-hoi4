 gv_news.1.title:0 "Roman Empire Siezes Moesia Superior"
 gv_news.1.desc:0 "The Roman Empire has officially annexed Moesia Superior from the nation of Illyria, sparking outrage across the international community. This bold move marks a clear violation of the Treaty of Adrianople (1922), which had firmly established Illyrian sovereignty over the region. Emperor Constantine XX addressed the Roman Senate, declaring, “The Roman people cannot be left divided by unjust borders. Moesia Superior is not a conquest — it is a reunification of our people.”.\n\nWhile the Roman population in the region has enthusiastically welcomed the annexation, the international community views this as a dangerous precedent. Illyria, unable to resist militarily, has issued a formal protest, accusing Rome of undermining peace agreements."
 gv_news.1.a:0 "Worrying."
 gv_news.1.b:0 "The Roman people will stand undivided."
 gv_news.1.c:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 
 gv_news.2.title:0 "Roman Empire Demands Moesian Submission"
 gv_news.2.desc:0 "The Roman Empire has successfully forced the Kingdom of Moesia into submission, reincorporating the region into imperial control. Moesia, a Roman-aligned rump state established after the Great War, had maintained its independence under the terms of the Treaty of Adrianople (1922). However, this latest development constitutes a clear breach of that agreement.\n\nWhile pro-Roman factions in Moesia have celebrated the move, the annexation has sparked outrage among international observers. The Illyrian government and other Balkan nations have condemned the submission, warning of destabilization across the region. The League of Nations has issued a stern rebuke but has yet to take action."
 gv_news.2.a:0 "Worrying."
 gv_news.2.b:0 "Glory to the Emperor!"
 gv_news.2.c:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 
 gv_news.3.title:0 "The Naissus Referendum"
 gv_news.3.desc:0 "In a historic referendum, the predominantly Roman-majority territories held by Illyria under the terms of the Treaty of Adrianople have voted overwhelmingly in favor of reunification with the Empire. Despite Illyrian protests claiming undue influence and pressure, the referendum process was endorsed by international observers as largely fair. However, tensions remain high as Illyria's government issues warnings about further Roman expansion.\n\nDiplomatic reactions have been mixed. While some Balkan states expressed concern, others acknowledged the legitimacy of the vote. The League of Nations has called for restraint on both sides to prevent an escalation of hostilities."
 gv_news.3.a:0 "Worrying."
 gv_news.3.b:0 "The Romans have spoken!"
 gv_news.3.c:0 "So be it."
 
 gv_news.4.title:0 "Roman Empire Annexes Dalmatia"
 gv_news.4.desc:0 "In a dramatic escalation of regional tensions, the Roman Empire has deployed its military to seize control of Dalmatia, a coastal region held by Illyria since the Treaty of Adrianople after the Great War. The region, home to a sizable ethnic Roman population, has been a point of contention between the two nations for over a decade.\n\nIllyria's government has condemned the occupation, accusing Rome of violating the Treaty of Adrianople and undermining regional stability. Calls for international intervention have been made, but the League of Nations has yet to issue a formal response.\n\nDiplomatic reactions are varied. Some nations have denounced the action as aggressive and destabilizing, while others have expressed cautious support, emphasizing the ethnic ties of Dalmatia’s population to Rome."

Estabilished as an elite institution for educating the empire's brightest minds, it has produced generations of engineers, architects and industrialists. In such uncertain times, with rapid advancements in electrical engineeringm aeronautics and modern infrastructure, the current facilities are deemed insufficient for the empire’s growing needs.\n\nIn a grand proclamation, the Emperor has announced a massive expansion and modernization program for the Collegium, aiming to transform it into the world’s leading center for technological innovation. The university was greatly expanded, renovated and officially reopened as the Imperial Institute of Engineering, becoming the intellectual and industrial powerhouse of the modern age."
